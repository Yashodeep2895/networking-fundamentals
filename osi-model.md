# OSI Model

The OSI model has 7 layers:

1. Physical – Cables, signals
2. Data Link – MAC addressing, switching
3. Network – IP addressing, routing
4. Transport – TCP and UDP
5. Session – Session management
6. Presentation – Encryption and formatting
7. Application – User-facing protocols

The OSI model helps understand how data moves through a network.
